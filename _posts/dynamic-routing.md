## Quick note
Hello, welcome to my blog. Here, I would like to share my stuffs, knowledge, and experience. The main reason that you are able to view this page is that I have been learning how to code with Next.JS, I've came across of this awesome framework and found out how easy it is to start, and deploy a website with Next.

I'm a cyber security guy, I usually write scripts to automate task, process data, and some backend logic. Additionally, I also write queries in different form to craft alerts and dashboard for SIEM.
